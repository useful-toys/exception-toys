/**
 * Marks a code point that has not yet been implemented. Signals that there is

 * <p>
 * This is a generic mark. There are more specific marks that should be
 * preferred:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link UnimplementedConditionException}
 * <li> {@link UnimplementedException}
 * <li> {@link UnimplementedMethodException}
 * </ul>
 * <p>Example:
 * <pre>
 * while (true) {
 *   bla bla bla (no break anywhere);
 * }
 * // One does not know how to implement this algorithm after the loop.
 * throw new UnimplementedConstrolStateException();
 * </pre>
